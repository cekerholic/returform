# Mobile eCommerce Product Return Concept

From buyer perspective, returning purchased items due to defects or another issues is an unpleasant experience. So it is important for an eCommerce site to provide Product Return mechanism that simple and easy to use to maintaining user satisfaction.

In this concept, my approach is like this:

## 1. Provide Helpful Guide

We should inform buyer a step by step guide and the return policy as well (if any). A great copy is needed, preferably with illustration. In this concept I try to show the reward to buyer in the very top of the page ([in index page][1], highlighted with red background). Then I show them a return guide and the required steps (taking pics of the item and delivery receipt).

## 2. Minimalize User Actions

More steps equals more actions, and more actions will increase user frustation as well as the probability of error.

1. If user logged in, when she click **ISI FORM PENGEMBALIAN PRODUK** in guide page, she will presented with the list of her order history that still eligible for returning ([step 2 page][3]).
2. If not logged in she will presented with an input form, she will only need to provide her email address or phone number ([step 1 page][2]). Upon submitting, system will send her a SMS/email verification, this step is necessary to prevent data abuse. When she click the verification link,
system should be able to pull her order history and redirect her to history page ([step 2 page][3]).
3. In order history page, she'll only need to select the product she'd like to return. When checked she will presented with a **Return Reason** select form and file upload to send the proof picture ([step 2 page][3]).
4. Then she will presented with proof of delivery page. She will need to upload the delivery receipt with the explanation that we will reimburse the delivery cost with shopping voucher. So she will feel rewarded and not frustated with the presence of additional form ([step 3 page][4])
5. After she finished the task in step 3 and 4, she will presented with the voucher that automatically generated for her as well as thank you note for her effort ([step 4 page][5])
